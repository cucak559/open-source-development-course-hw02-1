# Simple Vector implementation in python 

Very simple vector implementation supporting basic operations.

## Usage

```python
from ossdev import Vector
a = Vector([0, 1, 2, 3])
print(a)
```

Operations:
- Addition with a scalar `a+1`
- Vector addition: `a + b`
- Vector substraction: `a - b`
- Vector multiplication: `a * b`
- Vector xor: `a ^ b`
- Vector comapring, eg.: `a < b`
- Vector length: `a.length()`

## Installation

```bash
pip install -U --no-cache . 
```
